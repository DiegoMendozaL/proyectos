            <h2>The <span class="mark-block">most astonishing</span> guitar&nbsp;player ever.</h2>
            <p>Jean "Django" Reinhardt was a Belgian-born French jazz guitarist and composer of Romani ethnicity, regarded as one of the greatest musicians of the twentieth century, having written nearly 100 songs.</p>
            <p>He was the first and most significant jazz talent to&nbsp;emerge from Europe.</p>

        <p>Despite having two of his fingers disabled from a fire, he overcame the&nbsp;handicap and went on to forge an entirely new style of jazz guitar technique (sometimes called 'hot' jazz guitar), which has since become a living musical tradition within French Gypsy culture. </p>
  
        <p>Benny Goodman asked him to travel with his band, which he never did, but he did tour the U.S. with Duke Ellington's band in 1946. He died suddenly of a stroke at age 43.</p>
  
        <p>Many guitar players and other musicians have expressed admiration for Reinhardt or have cited him as a major influence. Jeff Beck described Reinhardt as "by far the most astonishing guitar player ever" and "quite superhuman".</p>

        <p>Because Reinhardt and his family were Gypsies, and he was also a jazz musician, he tried to escape from occupied France with his family. After his first attempt, he survived when a secretly jazz-loving German, Luftwaffe officer Dietrich Schulz-KÃ¶hn,
          let him go back to France after he was captured.</p>
  
        <p>During the occupation of France, Reinhardt continued playing and composing. One of his songs, "Nuages," became an unofficial anthem in Paris to signify hope for liberation. One day at a concert, the popularity of the song was such that the crowd
          made him replay the song three times in a row.</p>
